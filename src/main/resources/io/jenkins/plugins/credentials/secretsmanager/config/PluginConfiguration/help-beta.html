    <p>Enable experimental features.</p>
    <p>Warnings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No official support.</strong> Beta features are provided on a strictly best-effort basis.</li>
        <li><strong>Unstable code.</strong> Beta features may be added, changed, or removed between releases, without warning.</li>
        <li><strong>Unstable configuration.</strong> Beta feature configuration may be changed between releases, without warning.</li>
        <li><strong>Manual configuration updates required.</strong> Unlike regular features, you must update the configuration of beta features manually when their config schema changes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Recommendations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Test on a non-production Jenkins.</strong> This will allow you see whether the beta feature will work in your environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Read the plugin release notes.</Strong> Always read the release notes before upgrading the plugin, to check for beta feature changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Jenkins Configuration As Code (CasC).</strong> CasC will reject configuration that contains outdated or deleted properties, and warn you about it.</li>
    </ul>
