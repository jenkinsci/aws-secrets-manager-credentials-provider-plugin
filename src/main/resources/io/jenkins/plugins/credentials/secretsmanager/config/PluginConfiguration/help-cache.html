<p>Enable or disable the credentials cache.</p>
<p>When the cache is enabled, credentials are cached for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>You can disable the cache if necessary. This change may not be immediate on a running Jenkins server; it takes effect after the current cache expires. Please bear in mind the following consequences:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Disabling the cache increases load on the AWS <code>secretsmanager:ListSecrets</code> endpoint. In high load situations, Jenkins may exceed the endpoint's <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_limits.html">rate limit</a>.</li>
    <li>Disabling the cache increases the time required to look up credentials. (Every lookup will require network round-trips, which take time.)</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, you should generally avoid disabling the cache, except for testing purposes.</p>
