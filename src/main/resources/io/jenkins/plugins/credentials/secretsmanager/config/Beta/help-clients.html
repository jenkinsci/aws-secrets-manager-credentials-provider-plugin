    <p>The plugin can access more secrets using multiple AWS clients.</p>
    <p>The most common use case is to access secrets in other accounts using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html">cross-account roles</a>. In this setup, Jenkins accesses secrets in its own account using its (implicit) primary role, and is given a secondary client for each other account that it should read secrets from.</p>
    <p>Secrets in different accounts may have the same name. To allow them to co-exist within Jenkins, credentials from primary and secondary clients use different secret attributes for their IDs:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <td>Client</td>
            <td>Credential ID</td>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Primary</td>
            <td>Secret Name</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Secondary</td>
            <td>Secret ARN</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <p>For each secondary client:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create the role and associated policies in AWS.</li>
        <li>Test that Jenkins can assume the role and retrieve secrets.</li>
        <li>Add the role's ARN to the list below.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Considerations</h3>
    <p><strong>Do not add more clients than necessary.</strong> Each additional client creates another set of HTTP requests to retrieve secrets. This increases the time to populate the credential list. It also increases the risk of service degradation, as any of those requests could fail.
