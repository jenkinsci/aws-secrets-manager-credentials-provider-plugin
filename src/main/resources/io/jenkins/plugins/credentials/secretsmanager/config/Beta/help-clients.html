    <p>Enable this option to customise the Secrets Manager client(s) used to access secrets.</p>
    <p>The most common use case is to access secrets in other accounts using IAM <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html">cross-account roles</a>. In this setup, Jenkins performs *same-account* secrets access with its IAM principal's *implicit* role, and performs *cross-account* secrets access with *explicit* roles.</p>
    <p>With custom clients, you can decide:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Whether *same-account* secrets access should be enabled.</li>
        <li>Which *cross-account* calls you want to make.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The plugin de-duplicates client configurations (where two clients have the same credentials provider, endpoint configuration, and region) when you save the Jenkins configuration. This helps you to avoid redundant clients.</p>
    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <p>For each client:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create the associated IAM roles and policies in AWS.</li>
        <li>Ensure that Jenkins can assume the role and retrieve secrets.</li>
        <li>Add the client to this list.</li>
    </ol>
