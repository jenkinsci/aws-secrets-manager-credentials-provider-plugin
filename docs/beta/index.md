# Beta

The plugin sometimes contains beta features, to get community feedback. When present they are listed here.

## Warnings

- Beta features are not officially supported.
- Beta features may be added, changed, or removed without warning.
- Beta features may break Jenkins.
- Beta feature configuration must be manually updated when the config schema changes.

## Recommendations

- Test beta features on a non-production Jenkins.
- Read the plugin release notes before upgrading.
- Use Jenkins Configuration As Code (CasC). (CasC can warn you when the configuration schema changes.)
- Report bugs and feedback on the Jenkins issue tracker.
